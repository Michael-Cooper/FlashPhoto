			<h1><small><small> Syntax and general</small></small></h1>

			Use tab indentation (set to equivalent of four spaces). <br> <br>
			Always put statements inside control structures on a new line, and always use brackets for single-line conditionals. <br> <br>

			Avoid hard-coding values. Keep these values near the top of the file and use variables to refer to them. <br> <br>
Utilize good encapsulation principles, including calling wrapper functions rather than specific library functions where available. <br> <br>

	Add an extra line between functions, control structures, and other statements, unless they are closely related. This keeps the code readable. <br> <br>

In command-line mode, use exit values to communicate information. 0 means the program executed normally,
1 means the program executed with an error, and 2 means the program executed normally but with the special
meaning that the result of the compare function was ‘false’. <br> <br>

 <h1><small><small> Variable names</small></small></h1>

 Private attributes of a class begin with ‘m_’ <br> <br>
Use camel case for variable names as much as possible. <br> <br>
Use descriptive variable names using full English words as much as possible. Avoid variable names such
as “cc” or “dNum” that don’t have obvious meaning to someone reading through code for the first time. <br> <br>

Give iterator values descriptive names if appropriate. Otherwise, adhere to iterator names like ‘i',
‘j’, or ‘k’ as much as possible. Use ‘x’ and ‘y’ when iterating through pixels in a PixelBuffer. <br> <br>

 <h1><small><small> Documenting code </small></small></h1>
 Use comments to document intent for blocks of code with a comment line above the code block. <br> <br>
Clarify a single line by including a comment at the end of the line. <br> <br>
Comment after closing bracket of all structures longer than a page, to clarify which structure is
ending. For example, the closing bracket of a long for-loop would be followed by “// end for-loop.”
This improves readability and helps with debugging.  <br> <br>
