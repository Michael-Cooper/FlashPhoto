		The overall design of the project utilizes several design patterns in order to make the code as clean as possible,
		and as friendly as possible to future expansion.  First, let's look at a UML diagram describing the general layout
		of the major classes of the project:<br><br>

					<br><br>
			<img src="Project Design.png" align="center" valign="center" title = "Overall Project UML">
			<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

		This particular diagram
		 shows the FlashPhoto application, but the same diagram could be made with the Mia application.  They're very similar,
		  utilizing the same classes.  In fact, both programs are built upon a shared libphoto library, which holds all files
		   besides FlashPhoto.cpp and FlashPhoto.h, MIAApp.cpp and MIAAPP.h, and their two respective main.cpp files.
		   <br><br>

		  Separating the .cpp and .h files of the project from either specific application was one extremely important design decision that
		  allowed us to build two applications that are similar, but that target different uses.  Having everything in a library makes it
		  very easy to create these two applications by having them simply grab precisely what they need out of the library.  FlashPhoto is
		  an application geared more toward visual creation, with a greater creative suite of tools and filters to allow for more visual expression.
		  <br><br>
		  Mia, on the other hand, was created for use in hospitals, to view multi-layered images such as brain scans, and to be able to mark up the
		  images with lines and targets.  Since Mia doesn't need as many tools and filters, it simply ignores the c++ files it won't use.<br><br><br>

		  The project utilizes a few other useful design patterns, which we'll go over now:<br><br>

		<br>
		<b>Inheritance</b><br><br>

		Inheritance is used early and often throughout the design of this project.  Both FlashPhoto and Mia inherit from BaseGfxApp
		 in order to utilize its functionality in creating an interactive GUI for the user.<br><br>

		 <br><br>
			<img src="Tool.png" height= "400" width = "300" align="center" valign="center" title = "Tool inheritance">
			<br><br>

		 Each specific tool class also inherits from the main Tool class shown in the UML diagram below.  This allows us to avoid
		 repeating the code required to apply the tools to the canvas (for example, much of the code in the "applyToCanvas" method
		 can be used by multiple tools).  Occasionally, a specific tool would override the "applyToCanvas" method in order to
		 implement its special needs, and with inheritance all of that is very easy to do.<br><br>

		 <br><br>
			<img src="Filter.png" align="center" valign="center" title = "Filter inheritance">
			<br><br>

		 The specific filters were broken down in a similar fashion from the main Filter class, although there is an extra
		 layer of inheritance to accomodate the two different types of filters, namely convolution filters and non-convolutions
		 filters.  The inheritance structure worked well here as well.<br><br>

		 <br><br>
			<img src="FloatMatrix.png" height= "250" width = "300" title = "FloatMatrix inheritance">
			<br><br>

		Different masks and kernels were used to implement the tools and filters.  Ultimately, both kernels and masks are
		implemented through float matrices, so we had a FloatMatrix class that tools and filters used, and then an
		inheritance hierarchy under the FloatMatrix class to realize the various different kernels and masks needed
		given the specific tool or filter.  <br><br>


		<b>Strategy Pattern</b><br><br>

		We utilized the strategy pattern in a very helpful way in our design.  One example of its implementation is with the way masks and kernels
		were handled, as can be seen in the FloatMatrix inheritance diagram above.  Having this separated from the Tool and Filter classes allows
		the program to grab the kernel or mask algorithm it needs through the FloatMatrix.  This way, we can avoid an extremely messy inheritance tree
		in order to get the right combination of tool or filter and kernel or mask.<br><br>

		<b>Factory Pattern</b><br><br>

		The factory pattern can be clearly seen in the main UML diagram at the top of this page.  Our applications create and use multiple tools and
		filters, so rather than repeat the same code over and over to create these things, we have seperate factory classes to simplify and automate
		the task of tool and filter creation.  It also simplifies exapansion of the applications in the future, as creating new tools and filters
		is made easier.  Please visit our pages on adding new brushes and filters for more detail.<br><br>
