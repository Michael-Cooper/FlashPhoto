		<h1>Converting and Segmenting a CT Scan Using Mia</h1>
		<p>
		The feature that sets Mia apart from other image-editing software is its ability
		to apply adjustments to an entire stack of images easily, such as a stack of CT
		scan images with a single command in command line mode. It may be helpful to play
		around with graphics mode to decide your desired settings before filtering and saving
		hundreds of images in your system. <br><br>
		Once you know your desired settings, however, you will
		find command line mode to be extremely quick and easy to use. In this tutorial,
		I will walk through the process of converting and editing a stack of CT images in command line mode.<br><br>

		To process a stack of numbered image files with the command line, use the following command: <br><br>
		./Mia ct_scan_result###.png -blur 5 -quantize 4 ct_scan_processed###.jpg <br><br>
		The first argument,
		ct_scan_result###.png,
		is the name of the input files, but with the identifying number replaced
		with a###.png <br><br>
		This set of files has a 3-digit identifying number, but if, for example, your batch
		of files has a 5-digit identifying number, use five #'s instead. The next arguments are the filters
		we want to apply to the images. -blur represents the Blur filter, and itâs followed by the amount of blur we want. <br><br>
		Applying a blur filter reduces the noise in the image. -quantize represents the Quantize filter, and we specified 4
		for 4 segments, which will show the different regions of tissue more clearly. There are seven different filters
		in total that can be applied to each image using the following arguments. If the filter requires an input,
		like Blur and Quantize do, the input number must follow the filter name: <br><br>
		Sharpen filter: <br>
		-sharpen <br><br>
		Edge Detect filter:<br>
		-edgedetect<br><br>
		Threshold filter:<br>
		-thresh<br><br>
		Quantize filter:<br>
		-quantize <br><br>
		Blur filter:<br>
		-blur<br><br>
		Saturate filter:<br>
		-saturate<br><br>
		Multiply RGB filter:<br>
		-multrgb<br>
		[note: this filter requires 3 inputs, for the red value, the blue value, and the green value respectively] <br><br>
		The last argument is the output file name, again with the #âs at the end representing the identifying number.
		Notice that we can convert to .png to .jpg file extension, if we want.
		After running this command, there should be a new filtered image saved as the output file name for each of the numbered files
		 that match the pattern. <br><br>

		 Hours of work, done in two seconds!
