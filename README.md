# FlashPhoto
Written in C++


FlashPhoto is an image editor program developed for the Linux operating system.  It has various drawing tools and filters, and allows for image saving and loading.

FlashPhoto uses the GLUI library, itself built upon the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT).  It also uses The Independent JPEG Group and libpng libraries for file loading and saving in JPG and PNG formats.

There is also a sister program called Mia.  It is a more barebones version of FlashPhoto, designed for use through a shell.
