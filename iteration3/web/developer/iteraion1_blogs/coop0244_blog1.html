The code I've selected here is the algorithm to construct the mask for the spray tool.  The code iterates through<BR/>
a two dimensional float array, calculating how far each cell in the array is from the center of the double array,<BR/>
and storing that distance within the cell itself.
<BR/>
It then converts this number into an influence to be used in determining what ratio of color balance is needed<BR/>
between the selected color and the color on the canvas, for each pixel.<BR/>
<BR/>

To calculate the distance of each cell from the center of the double array, I use the distance formula, namely:<BR/>
<BR/>
square-root([x2 - x1]^2 + [y2 - y1]^2)<BR/>
<BR/>
where x1, y1 is the center of the double array.  This calculation gives me the distance in pixels from the current<BR/>
cell to the center cell.  I then divide this number by 100 to give me a decimal value between 0 and 1 to work with.<BR/>
<BR/>
To convert this to influence within this particular Spray tool, I begin with an inlufence variable of .2.  The idea is<BR/>
that if the distance of a cell is greater than or equal to 20 pixels(and therefore the number within the cell is equal to<BR/>
or between .2 and 1), then I don't want to apply any color at all.  As the cell gets closer to the center, I want it to<BR/>
apply more and more color, up to 20%(.2).  By setting the cell value to "(influence) - (cell value)" (and setting any calculated<BR/>
negative values to zero), I'll now have a cell value that represents, in percent, how much color to apply.<BR/>
<BR/>
The code is fairly straightforward, but this code snippet is also useful in that it can also serve as something a blueprint<BR/>
for how to go about building a mask for a tool, and how you want to think about what the values within each cell mean, and<BR/>
how to possibly go about calculating those values.  It's also particularly useful if distance-from-center matters in calculating<BR/>
those values.<BR/>

  CODE SNIPPET:<BR/>
  <BR/>
  <xmp>
  //calculating mask influence.  Each mask[k][b] value will end up representing the percentage (from 0 to 1) of the currently<BR/>
  //selected color to apply to the canvas.
  for (int k = 0; k < maskHeight; k++)
	{
		for (int b = 0; b < maskWidth; b++)
		{
			mask[k][b] = (sqrt(pow((k - centerX), 2) + pow((b - centerY), 2))) / 100;
			influence = .2;
			if (influence - mask[k][b] < 0) {mask[k][b] = 0;}
			else mask[k][b] = influence - mask[k][b];
		}
	}
}
